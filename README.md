Featured images for posts on Justin W. Flory's blog


## What

This repository contains the source SVGs used for blog posts that I author for my [personal blog](https://blog.justinwflory.com). Inspired by the [fedoramagazine-images](https://pagure.io/fedoramagazine-images) repo for the [Fedora Magazine](https://fedoramagazine.org), I use this repo similarly for creating unique featured images for my posts to make them more attractive for the reader, but also to up my personal design skills.
